I chose the chapter4 game and made the following modifications:
- I made the game start up faster by increasing the speed of the `generateNewPuzzle` function.
- I changed the color scheme to https://coolors.co/87a878-b0bc98-c7ccb9-cae2bc-dbf9b8
- I used PyCharm to reformat the file according to modern PEP standards.
