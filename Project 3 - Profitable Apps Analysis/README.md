# Project 3
 This project finds mobile app profiles that are profitable for 'Google Play' and 'App Store' markets. Using data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, our action plan is to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of app they create. The main goal is to analyze data to assist in developers understanding of what kinds of apps are most likely to attrach more users.
